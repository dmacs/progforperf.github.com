Please try out the list of optimziations provided in the following link:

You need not follow the 15 steps in sequences, you can skip the optimizations that you have already done.

The code generates a plot comapring two outputs. It uses Octave to generate the plots.

There is no Octave on Stampede. So, first develop and run the code in Stampede. Then, using sftp copy the entire code once to Lonestar.

In Lonestar, use the commands to load Octave: module load gnuplot
module load octave

Type Octave to enter octave. Then use the command "PlotAll" to generate the plots.
