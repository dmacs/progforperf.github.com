You need not follow the 15 steps in sequences, you can skip the optimizations that you have already done.<br/>

The code generates a plot comapring two outputs. It uses Octave to generate the plots.<br/>

There is no Octave on Stampede. So, first develop and run the code in Stampede. Then, using sftp copy the entire code once to Lonestar.<br/>

In Lonestar, use the commands to load Octave: module load gnuplot <br/>
module load octave

Type Octave to enter octave. Then use the command "PlotAll" to generate the plots.<br/>
